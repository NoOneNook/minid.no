**If you are going to have services from the state and municipality carried out digitally, you must have an electronic ID to be able to log in. This confirms that you are who you say you are.**

MinID is issued by the Directorate of Digitization and can be ordered from the year you turn 13. When you create a MinID, you are also registered in the [contact register](https://eid.difi.no/nb/kontakt-og-reservasjonsregisteret).

The contact register is used by the state and municipality to notify you. You must therefore register your mobile number and/or email address, so that the public can reach you with important information. For example, it could be a decision that applies to you, a letter from the municipality, a reminder about agreements or a notice about shutting off water.


**What can you use your eID for**

MinID is free and is often the first electronic ID that citizens of Norway acquire. Other eIDs are, for example, BankID on mobile and Buypass ID, which give you the highest level of security and thus access to even more digital services.

With an electronic ID, you can, for example

 - Apply for a place in upper secondary education.
 - Apply for a scholarship in LÃ¥nekassen.no.
 - Receive and store important letters in your digital mailbox.
 - Sign agreements, contracts and other important documents digitally.
 - Report a move or change your tax card at Skatteetaten.no.

You can have several electronic IDs that you can use to log in to public services. You can choose from five options. You can read more about that at [Norge.no](https://www.norge.no/en/digital-citizen/electronic-id).
