**If you are going to have services from the state and municipality carried out digitally, you must have an electronic ID to be able to log in. This confirms that you are who you say you are.**

MinID is a personal electronic ID that gives access to public services at a significant level of security (level 3).

MinID is issued by the Directorate of Digitization and can be ordered from the year you turn 13. When you create a MinID, you are also registered in the [contact register](https://eid.difi.no/nb/kontakt-og-reservasjonsregisteret).

The contact register is used by the state and municipality to notify you. You must therefore register your mobile number and/or email address, so that the public can reach you with important information. For example, it could be a decision that applies to you, a letter from the municipality, a reminder about agreements or a notice about shutting off water.
